# Neopolitan Pizza Calculator

:pizza: A simple app to calculate the amount of ingredients needed to make neopolitan-style pizza dough. I use this to make gluten dough for friends and family and gluten-free dough for myself. Default water content values are based on an oven temp of 550F (289degC), personal preference, and specific environmental variables.
